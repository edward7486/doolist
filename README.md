# Doolist
My first React web application. Yet another to do list beginner project but I wanted to spice it up and make it more challenging for my own learning. Some of the key features:

- You can mark and unmark to dos as done, as well as delete them
- When you click to delete, there is a modal dialog asking for confirmation
- Clicking on a todo's label opens an "edit panel", a more detailed view of that item
- From the edit panel you can add comments to your todo, mark them done/undone and set a status
- Each task's edit panel has a unique url based on the item's unique ID, refreshing the window keeps you on the page. I did this with the idea of sharing tasks with others once I work in task sharing
- Interacting with the status to make it open or complete will mark it undone or done accordingly
- Project settings allows you to rename your project and set whether to show your completed items
- Clear completed items

# Future updates

- I plan to add a "card view" and afford "drag and dropping" of items to sort the list. The card view will also allow dragging to update the status from "open" to "complete" or "in progress"
- The ability to add more projects 

# Details
- This application uses local storage for now as I'm still learning
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
